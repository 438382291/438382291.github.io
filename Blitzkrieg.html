        <p2> Blitzkrieg is a method of warfare where the attacker, spearheaded using a force concentration of armoured and motorised or mechanised infantry
             formations with close air support, breaks through the opponent's line of defence by short, fast, powerful attacks and then dislocates the defenders,
              using speed and surprise to encircle them with the help of air superiority.[1][2][3] Through the employment of combined arms in manoeuvre warfare,
              blitzkrieg attempts to unbalance the enemy by making it difficult for it to respond to the continuously changing front, then defeat it in a decisive
                Vernichtungsschlacht. </p2>
        <br>
        <p2>During the interwar period, aircraft and tank technologies matured and were combined with systematic application of the traditional German tactic of
            Bewegungskrieg (maneuver warfare), deep penetrations and the bypassing of enemy strong points to encircle and destroy enemy forces in a Kesselschlacht
            (cauldron battle).[3][6] During the Invasion of Poland, Western journalists adopted the term blitzkrieg to describe this form of armoured warfare.[7]
            The term had appeared in 1935, in a German military periodical Deutsche Wehr (German Defence), in connection to quick or lightning warfare.[8]
             German manoeuvre operations were successful in the campaigns of 1939–1941 and by 1940 the term blitzkrieg was extensively used in Western media.[9][10]
              Blitzkrieg operations capitalized on surprise penetrations (e.g., the penetration of the Ardennes forest region), general enemy unreadiness and their
               inability to match the pace of the German attack. During the Battle of France, the French made attempts to re-form defensive lines along rivers but were
                frustrated when German forces arrived first and pressed on.[10]  </p2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p2> Despite being common in German and English-language journalism during World War II, the word Blitzkrieg was never used by the Wehrmacht as an official military term,
             except for propaganda.[9] According to David Reynolds, "Hitler himself called the term Blitzkrieg 'A completely idiotic word' (ein ganz blödsinniges Wort)".[11]
              Some senior officers, including Kurt Student, Franz Halder and Johann Adolf von Kielmansegg, even disputed the idea that it was a military concept.
              Kielmansegg asserted that what many regarded as blitzkrieg was nothing more than "ad hoc solutions that simply popped out of the prevailing situation".
              Student described it as ideas that "naturally emerged from the existing circumstances" as a response to operational challenges.[12] The Wehrmacht never officially adopted
               it as a concept or doctrine.[a] </p2>

            <p2>Some elements that were crucial to the success of the tactic were:  </p2>
                <ul>
               <li>Dive bombers</li>
               <li>Light tanks</li>
               <li>Paratroopers</li>
               <li>Aerial Superiority</li>
               </ul>
